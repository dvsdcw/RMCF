To ensure the fairness of the experimental process and the comparability of the results, all the experiments in this study were completed in a unified hardware platform and software environment.All experimental evaluations were performed on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU with Windows 11 OS,24GB memory capacity, utilizing PyTorch 1.9.1 and CUDA 11.3. The target detection models were developed using Python and trained with the PyTorch framework. The learning rate for the training was initialized at 0.001, with the training process involving 300 iterations and batch size of 16. The SGD optimizer was used for training with Num-workers of 8, 300 rounds of loops, momentum of 0.937,image size of 640Ã—640, and decay coefficient of 0.0005.
